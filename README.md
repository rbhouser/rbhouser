- 👋 Peace and Blessings, I am Robert Houser.  My mother named me Robert because the name came to her in a dream.  Robert corresponds to “shining flame.”  Several times, people have stated: My walking into a room tends to shine a light in it, or bring the room to life.

- 👀 I was born and raised in the Harlem area of New York, NY before drugs were sent in to open the way great migration for Urban Renewal.  Because of the Pan-African and Afro-centric awakening in the 1980s following the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and cultural renaissance of the 1970s, I was able to begin my personal and spiritual development and quest to realize my ability to awaken and use all my talents to help and benefit a larger whole.

  My vision is to awaken my abilities (talents and states of awareness) to live in and to promote an interdependent world that is above functioning out of a belief system that is based in material and emotional gratification.

  Welcome to all those with the same vision that join me at least attaining and maintaining love as state of being to open the way to joy and peace.

- 🌱 My interests are many.  Sometimes, the activities and projects which are enjoyable are not the activities and projects that require my attention.  My plan is to always put needs before wants.  

  For 2021 and 2022, my focus is conflict resolution and building a sustainable work-life balance. In pre-COVID19 pandemic times, we were hearing about people needing to do better in managing their two lives: 1) business (how to make a living) or work, and 2) personal (how to socialize with family and people with similar non-business interest) or life.  In these contemporary times, being in a technology related field; the goal for most people is to achieve being involved in meaningful endeavors that sustain and serve having a better Earth.  We need to live in a world where we are calm and do no harm.

- 💞️ I tend to be a team person.  My desire in tend towards doing creative things.   The child in me is enjoys building things.  The adult wants to help others by solving problems.  Some people enjoy playing chess.  I see two people battling each other as a waste of time and energy because they can use their critical thinking to work together and solve a common problem or build something that is the solution to a community problem.
